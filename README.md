# PreservingAlbania project
PreservingAlbania is a platform website that intends to document some of the main traditional albanian houses and their architecture in some of the main, most important cities and villages of Albania.

## Update data
At the moment the project fetches data from https://github.com/OpenLabsHackerspace/libocon-events project which I am using the codebase from.
Orginal codebase from:  https://saveyourinternet.today/ .
